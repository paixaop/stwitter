Post to multiple Twitter accounts, check friends time lines, and status from command line, or in batch mode, without having to type a single key at the computer you are using to access the Internet.

StealthTwitter also works with Tor to ensure that your privacy, and indirect access to Twitter even if the site is blocked by local firewalls.

StealthTwitter allows fast, and private, access to Twitter by combining the power and privacy of Tor (http://www.torproject.org/) with a command line Twitter client.

The goal of StealthTwitter is not to be a beautiful and graphical, but stealth, fast and automated.

You can post dozens of Twitts, get friend status, and time line, automatically and privately without having to type a single key. This is important if you are accessing Twitter from an untrusted computer, that may be running key loggers.

Connections to Twitter are made through, a secure and private Tor connection, your IP address, or identity will not be revealed.
